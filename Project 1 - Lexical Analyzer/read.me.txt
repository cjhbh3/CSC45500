Bugs: None
Soultion Details: The way I went about solving this issue was to start with the provided code from the in class example.
I then identified the differences in that Lexical Analyzer and adapted the code to include project specific details.
I started by building the DFA table (in Excel), which helped me to understand how to code the 2D array DFA.
Then, I filled the DFA table with proper state transitions.
Once that was done, I moved on to working with the character getting. This was pretty straightforward but the major roadblocks I ran into were
1. Accidentally putting back a # (which would cause the program to infinitely hit a comment)
2. Counting line numbers correctly.
