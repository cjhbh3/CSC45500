Name: CJ Hess
Platform: Windows, Compiled and Tested on Linux
Compile: Nothing in particular - the makefile gave me some trouble originally, but I fixed that.
Run: Run using the following ./execName inputFile
Bugs: Nothing involving the freelist works. I really didn't understand how to implement the freelist and 
ran out of time trying to figure it out.
Soultion Details: This was a really interesting project to work on, just as a beginning thought.
As far as my solution, the BNF was really easy to adjust Project's 2 code, but trying to add on the additional
functionality was a little difficult.
